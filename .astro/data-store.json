Factory-built components arrive ready for assembly, reducing on-site labor and weather delays. This approach is particularly effective for repetitive structures like apartments and offices.\n\nWhile initial setup costs can be higher, the speed and precision of modular methods often result in overall project savings. As the industry embraces off-site manufacturing, expect to see more innovative applications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nComponents are manufactured in controlled factory environments. Quality control is maintained throughout production. Modules are transported to site for final assembly.\n\n## Advantages\n\nWeather-independent construction reduces schedule delays. Factory precision minimizes on-site errors. Reduced waste improves sustainability metrics.\n\n## Applications\n\nHotels, student housing, and military facilities benefit most. Healthcare and education sectors appreciate the speed and predictability.
